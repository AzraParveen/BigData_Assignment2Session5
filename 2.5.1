cluster >
In a computer system, a cluster is a group of servers and other resources that act like a
single system and enable high availability and, in some cases, load balancing and parallel
processing.In personal computer storage technology, a cluster is the logical unit of file 
storage on a hard disk; it's managed by the computer's operating system. Any file stored 
on a hard disk takes up one or more clusters of storage.A file's clusters can be scattered
among different locations on the hard disk. The clusters associated with a file are kept 
track of in the hard disk's file allocation table (FAT). When you read a file, the entire 
file is obtained for you and you aren't aware of the clusters it is stored in.



Hadoop Cluster>
A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing
and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.Such 
clusters run Hadoop's open source distributed processing software on low-cost commodity computers.
Typically one machine in the cluster is designated as the NameNode and another machine the as 
JobTracker; these are the masters. The rest of the machines in the cluster act as both DataNode
and TaskTracker; these are the slaves. Hadoop clusters are often referred to as "shared nothing"
systems because the only thing that is shared between nodes is the network that connects them. 

Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis applications. They also are highly
scalable: If a cluster's processing power is overwhelmed by growing volumes of data,additional cluster
nodes can be added to increase throughput.Hadoop clusters also are highly resistant to failure because
each piece of data is copied onto other cluster nodes, which ensures that the data is not lost if one 
node fails.
